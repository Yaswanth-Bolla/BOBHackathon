## Project Title
**AI-Driven Bank Efficiency: Crowd Management, Security, and Virtual Assistance**

## Overview
This project aims to enhance operational efficiency in banks by integrating AI and computer vision technologies. The focus areas include:

1. **Customer Queue Management:** Using OpenCV and YOLO algorithms to count the number of people in the bank, providing real-time crowd data to help customers avoid peak hours and long queues.
2. **AI-Driven Virtual Assistants:** Implementing chatbots to handle routine customer inquiries and transactions, freeing up staff for more complex tasks.
3. **Security Monitoring:** Employing machine learning algorithms for real-time monitoring to detect unusual patterns or behaviors, such as potential security threats.
4. **Predictive Analytics:** Training models on historical data to predict customer flow patterns, allowing for optimized staff scheduling and preparation for high-traffic periods.
5. **Scalability and Flexibility:** Developing a system that can be deployed across various bank branches, with the flexibility to incorporate additional functionalities as needed.
